# [WIP] mspa-notifier
This project intends to create a notifier for the Homestuck^2 and Vast Error webcomics, with custom, noisy, startling, screen-height image notifications (who likes the boring toast notifications anyway?)
In the long run, I'd like it to become a full-fledged customizable notifier, with the ability to tap into any RSS feed and detect changes in a website's element (supplied by xpath).

## Prerequisites
The code requires `python 3`.

## Installation
Pull or download the repository. Then run `pip3 -r install requirements.txt` from the and you're good to go!
