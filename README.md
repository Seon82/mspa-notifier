# [WIP] mspa-notifier
This project intends to create a notifier for the Homestuck^2 and Vast Error webcomics. Complete with custom, noisy, startling, intrusive image notifications (who likes those boring toast notifications anyway?)\
In the long run, I want it to become a full-fledged customizable notifier, with the ability to monitor into any RSS feed and detect changes in a website's element (supplied through an xpath by the user), thus giving anyone the convenience of getting all their updates in one place. And also in a fun form factor!
## Prerequisites
The code requires `python 3`.

## Installation
Pull or download the repository. Then run `pip3 -r install requirements.txt` and you're good to go!
